	St. Gregory  High School established by Rev. Father Gregory De Groote, a Benedictine Priest in January 1882 set many historical records towards its journey of education as well as humanitarian activities. 
	<br>
 

The school came into being with a handful of boys. But soon school had to be closed down twice. The school resumed then in 1889 and Father Francis Boeres CSC took the charge of the school. Within twenty years, he set the school upon its solid foundation by his untiring efforts. The school was initially used to teach only Eurasian and European children. Indian students were only allowed under special permission and that was only fifteen percent. In 1898 there were six Bengali boys and two Bengali girls among the students. In 1912 the girls section was separated from the boys and St. Francis Xavier’s came into existence.

 <br>

In 1924 Board’s recognition was granted and in 1928 six boys were sent for high school exam and all came out with good results. In 1934 Dalim Guha topped the list in the board exam. He was one of the best products of St. Gregory’s High School. He also stood first in ISC and stood First Class First in BSC with Honors in Physics from Calcutta University in 1938. In the same year his friend Protap Chandra stood third in the board Examination with letter marks in English, a very rare event. He also got a record of getting 97 percent marks in History from the Board of Intermediate, Calcutta University. In 1936, 37, 38 Nirmal Chandra Basu Roy, Jatindralal Das, Abdur Rouf, stood First in the Board Examination respectively. In 1941 Ashim Kumar Mukherjee came first in merit. After three years (1944) St. Gregory’s boys got 6 positions in the merit list including the first and second position occupied by Tarak Das and Arun kumar Basak respectively. Tajuddin Ahmed the First Prime Minister of Bangladesh secured 12th place in the merit list.

In the year 1947 the first, second and third position in the merit list were  captured by , Nirmal Chakraborty, AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury, the 13th President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and Samir Sen respectively.

The year 1959, 60, 61 were remarkable years in the history of the school. Syed Tareque Ali, Ahmed Shafee and Mahboob Hossain Khan topped the list again. In 1963 M. Sajjad Alam stood 2nd in the merit list from Science Group.  After four years again St. Gregory’s Boys did marvelous result in the board examination.

After liberation in the year 1973 there was also a remarkable result in the board examination. Three top most positions were achieved by Khandaker Nazrul Kader, Saad Akhter khan and Md. Habibur Rahman respectively. The tradition of doing excellent result is still going in and it is now valued with different criteria like GPA 5. In the present grading system, the students are proving their excellence also in the same manner.

The laurel of success was not only evident in the field of academic record but also in co-curricular activities St. Gregory’s boys set Hall mark in the history through their achievements.

The co- curricular activities started basically just from the outset of the 20th century.  The Scout Troop first in Dhaka was started at St. Gregory in 1914 just one year prior to the 1st World War and within a month 40 Scouts became member of that troop.  Br. Fabian , Mr. Alfred Palmer, Mr. Nicholas Rozario, brought fame and glory to our scout troop.  By 1916 the Cadet Corps became strong and started flourishing and 33 cadets were rated as extra efficient by the Army Officers.  During the world War, many of the cadets were given Officers’ commission. This year two scouts, Imtiaz Ahmed Sakib and Taufiqul Alam of St. Gregory’s High School have been nominated to receive President’s Scout Award for their excellent performance.

 <br>

Once in the 30th‘Bratachari Andalon’ a social movement influenced the whole country. Reverend Brother Walter realized the importance of the movement and introduced it at school.  The Bratachari drill classes, St John’s Ambulance Brigade performances were held after school regularly.
