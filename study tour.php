Participating in a course like the Study Tour of Japan gives students an education that goes beyond learning in a university classroom and the typical tourist experience. Students gain firsthand knowledge of life in Japan from those who live there.

The purpose of the trip is to provide students with an initial exposure to Japanese culture and society, says Dr. Catherine Kingfisher, a University of Lethbridge anthropology professor, who, along with Diane Minamide, co-ordinator of International Programs and Exchanges, took 14 students to Japan for almost four weeks of intense learning this past summer. For me as an anthropologist, I couldnâ€™t think of a better way to teach a course than on site.
