Science Club is a successful approach to STEM education that integrates high quality, hands-on instruction with a deep commitment to serving our community. Relationships are at the core of our approach- between kids and mentors, teachers and scientists, the university and community organizations.<br>
The  Science Club approach is the basis of two key initiatives: a mentor-driven afterschool program for middle school youth and a practicum-based teacher professional development program. Both are built on the same mentorship-based approach to science learning and teaching.
