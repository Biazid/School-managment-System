  		 What is English club? 
  		 <br>
  		 An English Club is a place for language learners to use English in a casual setting. Practising your skills in the classroom is important, but it is not like real life. In the classroom, you often focus on one skill and one item.
  		 <br>
  		 For many English learners, speaking is the most difficult part of the language to master. To improve your speaking skills, you need to be able to practice with other English learners or English speakers.
  		 <br>
         One way to do this is by joining or starting an English club. In today’s Education Tips, we discuss how English clubs can be helpful to your language-learning process.
         <br>
         This is part one of a two-part series on English clubs. In this episode, we offer advice for how to start and organize an English club. In next week’s episode, we will suggest some fun and educational activities for your club.
