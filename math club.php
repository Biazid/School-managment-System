Mathematics is an important part of everybody's life. All individuals require basic mathematical knowledge and skills in their daily lives. Mathematics educators have a responsibility to instill these basics into all students.

For those with average or below average mathematical aptitude, the proper motivation and encouragement is required to achieve the basic levels required in life. For those with natural mathematical ability, stimulation and challenges will drive them to pursue higher levels of mathematical knowledge and skills that will be needed by their future endeavors.

Fun Math Club believes that everyone can enjoy and appreciate mathematics. Enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics are required to provide the motivation and stimulation needed any individual to pursue mathematics education to the highest level that he or she can achieve.
